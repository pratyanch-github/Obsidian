### Copying Objects and Variables in JavaScript

1. **Copying Variables:**
   - **Primitive variables (e.g., numbers, strings):** When you copy a variable, you are copying the value.
   - **Example:** 
     ```javascript
     let a = 10;
     let b = a; // b is now 10
     ```

2. **Copying Objects:**
   - **By default, objects are copied by reference.** This means if you copy an object, both the original and the copy refer to the same object in memory.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let obj1 = { name: 'Alice' };
     let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 refers to the same object as obj1
     obj2.name = 'Bob';
     console.log(obj1.name); // Output: Bob
     ```

3. **Shallow Copying Objects:**
   - **To copy an object by value (shallow copy):**
     - **Using `Object.assign()`:**
       ```javascript
       let original = { name: 'Alice' };
       let copy = Object.assign({}, original);
       ```
     - **Using the spread operator (`...`):**
       ```javascript
       let original = { name: 'Alice' };
       let copy = { ...original };
       ```
   - **Note:** Shallow copying only copies top-level properties. Nested objects are still copied by reference.

4. **Deep Copying Objects:**
   - **To copy nested objects by value (deep copy):**
     - **Using `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify`:**
       ```javascript
       let original = { name: 'Alice', details: { age: 25 } };
       let copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
       ```
     - **Limitations:** This method does not copy functions or Date objects.

5. **Deep Copying with Lodash:**
   - **To handle deep copying including functions and dates, use Lodash:**
     - **Using `_.cloneDeep` from Lodash:**
       ```javascript
       let original = { name: 'Alice', details: { age: 25 }, date: new Date(), greet: () => console.log('Hello!') };
       let copy = _.cloneDeep(original);
       ```

Let's break down the concepts of reference copy, shallow copy, and deep copy in JavaScript, along with an explanation of the rest and spread operators, and then look at the example involving objects and a frequency counter.

### Reference Copy

A reference copy means that two variables point to the same object in memory. Changes to one variable will affect the other because they both reference the same underlying data.

### Shallow Copy

A shallow copy creates a new object and copies the top-level properties of the original object to the new object. However, if the original object has nested objects, the nested objects are still referenced, not copied. This means changes to nested objects in either the original or the copy will affect both.

### Deep Copy

A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all properties of the original object to the new object. This includes nested objects, so changes to the nested objects in the original or the copy will not affect each other.

### Rest and Spread Operators

- **Spread Operator (`...`)**: Used to spread out elements of an array or properties of an object.
- **Rest Operator (`...`)**: Used to collect remaining elements or properties into an array or object.

### Code Example

Here's the provided code with explanations and an example of each concept:

```javascript
let obj = {
    name: 'ram',
    addr: { city: 'ayodhya', state: 'up' },
    arr: [1, 2, 3],
    fun: () => { console.log('good') }
};

// Shallow copy using Object.assign
let user = Object.assign({}, obj);
obj.name = 'krishna';
obj.addr.city = 'gokul';
obj.fun = () => { console.log('bad') };
obj.arr[0] = 5;

// Changing the copied object
user.name = 'shiv';
user.addr.city = 'kailash';

// Output after modifications
console.log(obj); // { name: 'krishna', addr: { city: 'kailash', state: 'up' }, arr: [5, 2, 3], fun: [Function] }
obj.fun();        // Output: bad
user.fun();       // Output: good

// Using spread operator for shallow copy and adding a new property
let newobj = { ...obj, surname: 'dongre' };

// Using rest operator to destructure and copy remaining properties
let { name: sanki, ...restCopy } = obj;
obj.addr.city = 'gwaior'; // Nested objects are linked with reference
obj.name = 'pratyanch';   // Top-level properties are copied by value

console.log(restCopy);    // { addr: { city: 'gwaior', state: 'up' }, arr: [5, 2, 3], fun: [Function] }
// console.log(newobj);   // { name: 'krishna', addr: { city: 'gwaior', state: 'up' }, arr: [5, 2, 3], fun: [Function], surname: 'dongre' }

// Frequency counter example
const str = "aabbccd";
let freq = {};

for (let ch of str) {
    if (freq[ch]) {
        freq[ch] += 1;
    } else {
        freq[ch] = 1;
    }
}

for (let ele of Object.keys(freq)) {
    console.log(ele, freq[ele]);
    if (freq[ele] < 2) {
        delete freq[ele];
    }
}

console.log(freq); // { a: 2, b: 2, c: 2 }
```

### Explanation

1. **Reference Copy**: Modifying `obj.addr.city` affects `user.addr.city` because both point to the same nested object.
2. **Shallow Copy**: `Object.assign({}, obj)` creates a shallow copy. Changes to top-level properties are independent, but nested objects are shared.
3. **Deep Copy**: Not shown in this example, but a deep copy can be created using libraries like `lodash` or by manually copying properties recursively.
4. **Rest and Spread**: The spread operator is used to create `newobj` by copying properties of `obj` and adding a new `surname` property. The rest operator is used to create `restCopy`, which contains all properties of `obj` except `name`.
5. **Frequency Counter**: The code counts character frequencies in a string and removes characters that appear less than twice. This demonstrates working with objects as frequency maps.

This should give you a good understanding of the concepts and their application in JavaScript.
