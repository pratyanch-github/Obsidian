1. Types of keys 
   - What - Keys are set of attributes that are used to find a particular row or keys or set of attributes that can be used to find all the other attributes present in the table
   - As there are various types of keys in DBM S the word key doesn't mean anything and all the set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row or all the other attributes of the relational table are called Super Keys instead of just keys.
   - Candidate key- those super keys are called candidate keys whose no proper subset belongs to super keys
   - Primary key- we only have one primary key in a table and this key is generally selected by database administrator. Primary key is nothing but one of the candidate keys selected by the administrator
