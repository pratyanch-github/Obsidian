vitamin d  + magneesium for sleep

The issues you're experiencing—weakness, daytime sleepiness, difficulty sleeping at night, memory loss, gynecomastia, and difficulty concentrating—could be related to several factors, including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, or other health conditions.

Here are some vitamins and minerals that are often associated with the symptoms you've described:

1. **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can lead to fatigue, weakness, and mood changes. It’s also important for overall health.
    
2. **B Vitamins**: Particularly B12 and B6, which are important for energy levels, brain function, and mood regulation. A deficiency can lead to memory issues and fatigue.
    
3. **Magnesium**: Important for sleep regulation and can help with muscle function and energy levels. Low magnesium can contribute to sleep disturbances and fatigue.
    
4. **Zinc**: Deficiency can affect immune function and may contribute to fatigue and cognitive issues.
    
5. **Iron**: Low iron levels can lead to anemia, which can cause weakness and fatigue.
    
6. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Important for brain health and may help with concentration and mood.
    
7. **Hormonal Imbalances**: Gynecomastia can be related to hormonal issues, which may not be directly linked to nutritional deficiencies but could be influenced by overall health and nutrition.
