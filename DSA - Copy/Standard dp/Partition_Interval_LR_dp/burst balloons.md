### Explanation of Burst Balloons Problem with DP Approach

---

#### **Dynamic Programming (DP) State:**

- **State Definition:**
  The DP state `dp[i][j]` represents **the maximum coins we can collect by bursting all the balloons** between indices `i` and `j` in the given range. The indices `i` and `j` are inclusive.

- We add two boundary balloons (`1`s) at the start and end of the `nums` array, so the range `[i, j]` includes all the balloons between the boundaries of the array `nums`.

---

#### **Transitions:**

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  We want to calculate the best solution for a range `[i, j]`. To do this, we iterate over every possible `k` (balloon) between `i` and `j`, and try to burst it last. The cost of bursting the balloon `k` is determined by the value of its left neighbor (`nums[i-1]`) and its right neighbor (`nums[j+1]`) and the balloon `k` itself (`nums[k]`).
```
  - **Formula:**
    \[
    dp[i][j] = \max \left( \text{{coins}} + dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] \right) \text{ for each } k \in [i, j]
    \]
    
    Where `coins = nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1]`.

  - We divide the problem into three parts:
    1. Bursting all balloons on the left of `k` (i.e., from `i` to `k-1`).
    2. Bursting balloon `k` last.
    3. Bursting all balloons on the right of `k` (i.e., from `k+1` to `j`).
```
- The **base case** is when `i > j`, which means there are no balloons in the range. In this case, we return `0`.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Memoization table to store the results of subproblems
    vector<vector<int>> dp;

    // Function to calculate maximum coins from bursting balloons between indices i and j
    int f(int i, int j, vector<int>& nums) {
        // Base case: no balloons to burst
        if (i > j) return 0;

        // Return precomputed result if available
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];

        int ans = 0;
        // Try bursting each balloon k between i and j
        for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
            // Coins gained from bursting balloon k
            int coins = nums[i - 1] * nums[k] * nums[j + 1];
            // Solve left and right subproblems
            ans = max(ans, coins + f(i, k - 1, nums) + f(k + 1, j, nums));
        }

        // Store the result in the dp table and return
        return dp[i][j] = ans;
    }

    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Add boundary balloons with value 1
        nums.insert(nums.begin(), 1);  // Insert 1 at the beginning
        nums.push_back(1);             // Add 1 at the end

        // Initialize dp array with -1 (indicating uncomputed subproblems)
        dp.resize(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, -1));

        // Solve the problem for the entire range (1 to n) as the 0th and (n+1)th are boundary balloons
        return f(1, n, nums);
    }
};
```

#### **Edge Cases:**

1. **Empty Input Array:**
   - If `nums` is an empty array (`nums.size() == 0`), the result should be `0`. This is implicitly handled in the base case since there will be no balloons to burst.

2. **Single Balloon:**
   - If there is only one balloon, we will burst it directly, and the answer will be the product of the boundaries and the value of that balloon.

---

#### **Time Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n³)**
  - The recursion function `f(i, j)` is called for all combinations of `i` and `j` in the range `[1, n]`.
  - For each range `[i, j]`, we iterate over all possible `k` values between `i` and `j`, leading to three nested loops.
  - Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n³)`.

- **Space Complexity:** **O(n²)**
  - We use a 2D memoization table `dp[i][j]` of size `(n+2) x (n+2)` to store the intermediate results, leading to `O(n²)` space complexity.

---

#### **Things to Remember:**

1. **Boundary Balloons:**
   - Always insert `1` at the beginning and end of the `nums` array to handle the boundary cases. These imaginary balloons simplify the calculations by ensuring each balloon `k` always has left and right neighbors.

2. **Memoization:**
   - Memoization is critical for optimizing the recursive approach, as it avoids recalculating subproblems. Without memoization, the complexity would grow exponentially.

3. **Base Case:**
   - The base case of the recursion is when `i > j`, meaning there are no balloons to burst in the current range. In such cases, the answer is `0`.

---

#### **Tricky Parts:**

1. **Understanding the Recursion:**
   - The trickiest part is understanding that in the recursive approach, we always try to burst balloon `k` last for each subproblem. This ensures that the number of coins we get from bursting the balloons is maximized.

2. **Choosing the Correct Boundaries:**
   - We use `nums[i-1]` and `nums[j+1]` as the boundaries when calculating the coins for bursting balloon `k`. This takes into account the contribution of both the left and right parts of the current range.
