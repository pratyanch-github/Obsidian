Here are some common dynamic programming (DP) tricks and techniques that competitive programmers frequently use to optimize their solutions. These tricks help solve complex DP problems efficiently, handle edge cases, or optimize memory and runtime.

### 1. **Space Optimization (Reducing the DP Table Size)**
   - **What:** If your DP table only relies on the previous state (or a few previous states), you can reduce the space complexity by maintaining only those previous states instead of the entire table.
   - **Why:** This can significantly reduce memory usage from `O(n*m)` to `O(n)` or `O(m)`.
   - **How:** Instead of maintaining a 2D array, use just a 1D array or a few variables.
   - **Example:**
     - Transitioning from `dp[i][j]` to `dp[j]` by overwriting the same array or switching between two arrays for the current and previous rows.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
       for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
           dp[j] = ...;  // only need current and previous row
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Bitmasking for Subset Problems**
   - **What:** Use bitmasking to represent subsets and solve problems where subsets of elements need to be processed (like the Traveling Salesman Problem, or problems involving combinations of elements).
   - **Why:** It's a compact way to represent and manage subsets, especially when dealing with sets of small size (like 20-25 elements).
   - **How:** Use an integer to represent a set of binary flags, where each bit represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of an element.
   - **Example:** `dp[mask]`, where `mask` is a bitmask representing a subset of items.

   ```cpp
   for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
       for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
           if (mask & (1 << i)) {
               // Element i is included in this subset
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Memoization (Top-Down DP)**
   - **What:** Use recursion along with a table to store results of previously computed states, avoiding recomputation.
   - **Why:** When direct bottom-up DP is not obvious or harder to implement, memoization is a simpler approach.
   - **How:** Recursively compute the solution while storing answers to subproblems in a cache (memoization table).
   - **Example:**

   ```cpp
   vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(m, -1));  // -1 means uncomputed

   int solve(int i, int j) {
       if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];  // Return memoized result
       // Compute dp[i][j] and store in the table
       dp[i][j] = ...;
       return dp[i][j];
   }
   ```

### 4. **Knuth’s Optimization**
   - **What:** This is a technique to optimize certain DP problems where a recurrence relation has the form: `dp[i][j] = min(k=i..j) (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost(i,j))`.
   - **Why:** Normally, the complexity would be cubic, but Knuth's optimization reduces it to quadratic by adding a constraint on `k` based on an observation about the optimal substructure.
   - **How:** Use the "monotonicity" of the optimal partition index.
   - **Example:**
     - Commonly used in interval DP problems such as matrix chain multiplication.

### 5. **Divide and Conquer DP**
   - **What:** This trick is used to optimize problems where transitions have the form `dp[i][j] = min(k) (dp[i-1][k] + cost(k, j))` with the **quadrangle inequality** or **monotonicity** properties.
   - **Why:** It reduces a typical `O(n^2)` DP solution to `O(n log n)` or `O(n)`.
   - **How:** The idea is to divide the range of possible transitions and solve the problem recursively.
   - **Example:**
     - Problems like the convex hull trick (for linear functions) or optimization of DP over ranges.

### 6. **Sliding Window (Deque Optimization)**
   - **What:** Use a sliding window or deque to optimize transitions when they have a monotonicity property.
   - **Why:** It reduces the complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)` in some cases.
   - **How:** Maintain a deque where you store potential candidates for the optimal answer in a sliding window.
   - **Example:** Optimizing transitions where you can keep track of valid "previous states" in a range.

   ```cpp
   deque<int> dq;
   for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
       // Maintain the deque for the optimal solution in range
   }
   ```

### 7. **The Convex Hull Trick / Li Chao Tree**
   - **What:** A technique used for problems involving dynamic programming where you have to minimize or maximize linear functions.
   - **Why:** Instead of iterating through all possible linear functions, you maintain only the relevant functions in a structure (either convex hull or segment tree) and query it efficiently.
   - **How:** You either use a convex hull data structure or a Li Chao tree for maintaining lines and querying efficiently.
   - **Example:**
     - Used in problems like optimizing DP where the cost function involves linear equations.

### 8. **Coordinate Compression**
   - **What:** When the problem involves large values of indices or coordinates, compress the coordinates to smaller values while preserving their order.
   - **Why:** When memory or time constraints don’t allow using arrays with large indices, compressing the coordinates reduces the size of the DP table.
   - **How:** Replace large values with their ranks (i.e., sort them and map them to their positions).
   - **Example:** Used frequently in problems involving ranges or intervals where the values are too large to be used as indices directly.

   ```cpp
   vector<int> v = {1000, 2000, 5000}; // original coordinates
   map<int, int> compress;
   for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
       compress[v[i]] = i;  // compressed coordinates
   }
   ```

### 9. **SOS (Sum Over Subsets) DP**
   - **What:** Used for solving problems related to subsets where you need to compute a value over all subsets of a given set.
   - **Why:** It can reduce the complexity from `O(2^n * n)` to `O(2^n)`.
   - **How:** Instead of recalculating values for all subsets, you compute values for supersets by reusing results from smaller subsets.
   - **Example:** For each mask (subset), you can derive its value from smaller subsets using bitwise operations.

   ```cpp
   for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
       for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
           if (mask & (1 << i)) {
               dp[mask] += dp[mask ^ (1 << i)];  // Sum over subsets
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 10. **Iterative vs Recursive (Bottom-Up vs Top-Down)**
   - **What:** DP can be implemented either iteratively (bottom-up) or recursively (top-down with memoization).
   - **Why:** Bottom-up is generally faster because it avoids the overhead of recursion, while top-down is easier to implement and more intuitive in some cases.
   - **How:** In bottom-up, you fill the DP table in order of dependencies, whereas in top-down, you use recursion to solve smaller subproblems first.
   - **Example:** 

   ```cpp
   // Bottom-Up DP
   for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
       for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) {
           dp[i][j] = ...;
       }
   }
   ```
