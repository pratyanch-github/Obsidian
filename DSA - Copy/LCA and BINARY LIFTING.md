## Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting

### Problem Statement
Given a tree \( G \), for every query of the form (u, v), we want to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the nodes \( u \) and \( v \). The LCA is the node that lies on the path from \( u \) to the root and on the path from \( v \) to the root, and is the farthest from the root among all such nodes. If \( u \) is an ancestor of \( v \), then \( u \) is their LCA.

The algorithm described here will require \( O(N \log N) \) time for preprocessing the tree and \( O(\log N) \) time for each LCA query.

### Algorithm
For each node, precompute its ancestor at various levels above it: its ancestor one node above, its ancestor two nodes above, four nodes above, etc. These ancestors are stored in the array `up`, where `up[i][j]` is the \( 2^j \)-th ancestor of node \( i \). This allows jumping from any node to its ancestor in \( O(\log N) \) time. The `up` array is computed using a DFS traversal of the tree.

**Precomputing Ancestors (Binary Lifting Table)** For each node, we precompute its ancestors using a table `up` such that `up[i][j]` represents the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `i`. This allows us to jump to any ancestor in `O(log N)` time.

We perform a DFS traversal of the tree to fill this table. During DFS, for each node `v` and its parent `p`, we initialize `up[v][0] = p` (i.e., the immediate parent of `v`). For higher powers of two, we use:

`up[v][j] = up[up[v][j-1]][j-1]` --- i.e  2^3 rd ancestor of 

This means that the `2^j`-th ancestor of `v` is the `2^(j-1)`-th ancestor of the `2^(j-1)`-th ancestor of `v`.

Additionally, for each node, remember the time of its first visit (`tin`) and the time when we leave it (`tout`) during the DFS traversal. These times help determine in constant time if one node is an ancestor of another.

### Steps to Determine LCA
1. **Ancestor Check Using DFS Times**:
   - For a node \( u \) to be an ancestor of node \( v \), the following conditions must be true:
     - `tin[u] < tin[v]`
     - `tout[u] > tout[v]`
   - These conditions ensure that the subtree rooted at \( u \) contains the subtree rooted at \( v \).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For a query \( (u, v) \):
     - If \( u \) is an ancestor of \( v \), return \( u \).
     - If \( v \) is an ancestor of \( u \), return \( v \).
     - Otherwise, climb the ancestors of \( u \) using the `up` array until finding the highest node that is not an ancestor of \( v \).

3. **Binary Lifting**:
   - Start from the highest power of two and decrement until zero.
   - For each power \( i \), check if `up[u][i]` is not an ancestor of \( v \). If true, update \( u \) to `up[u][i]`.
   - The LCA will be the parent of the last updated \( u \).

### Implementation
The following implementation demonstrates the preprocessing and query answering for finding the LCA using binary lifting.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, l;
vector<vector<int>> adj;

int timer;
vector<int> tin, tout;
vector<vector<int>> up;

void dfs(int v, int p) {
    tin[v] = ++timer;
    up[v][0] = p;
    for (int i = 1; i <= l; ++i)
        up[v][i] = up[up[v][i-1]][i-1];

    for (int u : adj[v]) {
        if (u != p)
            dfs(u, v);
    }

    tout[v] = ++timer;
}

bool is_ancestor(int u, int v) {
    return tin[u] <= tin[v] && tout[u] >= tout[v];
}

int lca(int u, int v) {
    if (is_ancestor(u, v))
        return u;
    if (is_ancestor(v, u))
        return v;
    for (int i = l; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (!is_ancestor(up[u][i], v))
            u = up[u][i];
    }
    return up[u][0];
}

void preprocess(int root) {
    tin.resize(n);
    tout.resize(n);
    timer = 0;
    l = ceil(log2(n));
    up.assign(n, vector<int>(l + 1));
    dfs(root, root);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - `tin[v]` records the time when the DFS first visits node \( v \).
   - `tout[v]` records the time when the DFS finishes processing all children of node \( v \).
   - The `up` array is filled during the DFS, where `up[v][i]` represents the \( 2^i \)-th ancestor of node \( v \).

2. **is_ancestor Function**:
   - This function checks if node \( u \) is an ancestor of node \( v \) using the `tin` and `tout` times.

3. **lca Function**:
   - This function finds the LCA of nodes \( u \) and \( v \) using the binary lifting technique. It iterates from the highest power of two down to zero, updating \( u \) until finding the LCA.

4. **preprocess Function**:
   - This function initializes the `tin`, `tout`, and `up` arrays and starts the DFS from the root to fill these arrays.

This approach ensures efficient preprocessing and query answering for the LCA problem in a tree, leveraging DFS traversal times and binary lifting.
