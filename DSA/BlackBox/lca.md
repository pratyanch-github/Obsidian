For finding the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes in a tree, both **Binary Lifting (Binary Jumping)** and the **Euler Tour + RMQ** method are widely used, but each has its own advantages depending on the specific problem context.

### 1. **Binary Lifting (Binary Jumping)**

**Binary Lifting** preprocesses the tree by creating a table where each node stores its 2^i-th ancestor. Using this table, you can find the LCA in **O(log N)** time after an **O(N log N)** preprocessing.

#### **How it works:**
- Precompute ancestors for each node at powers of 2, i.e., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, and so on.
- To find the LCA of two nodes `u` and `v`, you "jump" up the tree using powers of 2, until both nodes reach the same ancestor.

#### **Advantages:**
- **Space-efficient:** Requires **O(N log N)** space.
- **Fast query time:** Once preprocessing is done, each query is answered in **O(log N)**.

#### **When to use:**
- When the tree is static (doesn't change often) and you need multiple LCA queries.
- If you want an easy-to-implement solution with optimal time complexity for both preprocessing and query.

### 2. **Euler Tour + RMQ (Range Minimum Query)**

The **Euler Tour + RMQ** approach involves performing a depth-first traversal (DFS) of the tree and recording the Euler Tour (the order of nodes visited) and their depths. Using this information, the LCA problem is reduced to a **Range Minimum Query** (RMQ) on the depths of nodes in the Euler Tour array.

#### **How it works:**
- Perform a DFS traversal and record the first occurrence of each node in the Euler Tour.
- Store the depth of each node along with its position in the Euler Tour.
- To find the LCA of two nodes, query the range in the Euler Tour between the first occurrences of the two nodes and find the node with the minimum depth.

#### **Advantages:**
- The query time can be reduced to **O(1)** with preprocessing using sparse tables or segment trees.
- Preprocessing time is **O(N)** for the Euler Tour and **O(N log N)** for RMQ construction.

#### **When to use:**
- When you need **O(1)** query time for LCA.
- When RMQ is already part of your problem and you can leverage it for efficient queries.

### **Recommended Approach:**

- **For most general cases** where the tree is static and multiple queries need to be answered efficiently, **Binary Lifting (Binary Jumping)** is the more straightforward and commonly used method due to its simplicity and good balance of preprocessing and query time.
  
- **Euler Tour + RMQ** can be better if you specifically need **O(1)** query time and can afford a more complex preprocessing step.

### **Which to choose?**

- **Choose Binary Lifting if:**
  - You are looking for an easy-to-understand and implement solution with balanced time complexities.
  - The number of queries isn't massive, and **O(log N)** query time is acceptable.

- **Choose Euler Tour + RMQ if:**
  - Your problem requires **O(1)** query time, and you're okay with the complexity of setting up RMQ.
  - RMQ is already being used in other parts of your problem.

For **competitive programming**, **Binary Lifting** is usually preferred because it is simpler to implement and performs very well in most cases.
