### Function Overriding: C++ vs Java

**Function Overriding** is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the child class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.

While both **C++** and **Java** support function overriding, there are some key differences in how this is handled in each language.

## **1. C++ Function Overriding**

### Characteristics:
- In C++, **overriding** is enabled by using **virtual functions** in the base class.
- To allow overriding, you declare the method in the base class as `virtual`.
- You can override a method without using any special keywords in the derived class.
- C++ supports **runtime polymorphism** via **pointers** and **references** to base class objects.
- The base class method should be **virtual** for runtime overriding, or else it will hide the method in the derived class and result in **function hiding** instead of overriding.
- To enforce function overriding in C++, you can use the `override` keyword in C++11, which ensures that the method in the derived class overrides a base class method.

### Example in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    // Base class method is virtual, allowing overriding
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Overriding the sound method
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal *animalPtr;
    Dog dogObj;

    animalPtr = &dogObj;
    // This will call the overridden method in Dog class
    animalPtr->sound();  // Output: Dog barks

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points in C++:
- **virtual keyword**: The base class method must be declared `virtual` to enable function overriding.
- **Pointers/References**: To achieve runtime polymorphism, you must use pointers or references to base class objects.
- **override keyword (C++11)**: Used in the derived class to ensure that the function is overriding a base class method.

## **2. Java Method Overriding**

### Characteristics:
- In Java, every non-static method is by default **virtual**, meaning it can be overridden unless marked as `final`.
- You don't need to declare methods as `virtual` in Java; they are implicitly ready for overriding unless specified as `final`.
- The overridden method must have the same return type or a subtype (covariant return types).
- The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is being overridden, which helps with code clarity and compile-time checking.
- Java supports **runtime polymorphism** using **references** to base class objects.

### Example in Java:
```java
class Animal {
    // Base class method
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding the sound method
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();
        // This will call the overridden method in Dog class
        animal.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

### Key Points in Java:
- **No virtual keyword**: In Java, methods are virtual by default, so you don't need the `virtual` keyword.
- **@Override annotation**: This annotation helps ensure that a method is overriding a parent class method.
- **final keyword**: Methods marked as `final` in Java cannot be overridden.
- **Runtime polymorphism**: Achieved via references to base class objects, similar to C++.

### **Comparison of Function Overriding:**

| Feature              | **C++**                                       | **Java**                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Method declaration    | Use `virtual` keyword in the base class.      | All methods are virtual by default.        |
| Enforcing override    | Use `override` keyword (C++11 and later).     | Use `@Override` annotation.                |
| Preventing override   | Use `final` keyword (C++11 and later).        | Use `final` keyword to prevent overriding. |
| Method resolution     | Done via **pointers/references** to base class.| Done via **references** to base class.     |
| Covariant return type | Supported in C++11 and later.                 | Supported natively.                        |
| Default method access | Methods are **not virtual** by default.       | Methods are **virtual** by default.        |

### **Differences:**

1. **Virtual Keyword**:  
   - **C++** requires you to declare a method as `virtual` in the base class to allow overriding.  
   - In **Java**, methods are virtual by default unless marked `final`.

2. **Override Checking**:  
   - In **C++**, the `override` keyword is optional but helps ensure that the derived method overrides a base class method.  
   - In **Java**, the `@Override` annotation is optional but recommended for similar reasons.

3. **Covariant Return Type**:  
   - Both **C++ (from C++11)** and **Java** support covariant return types, allowing the overridden method in the subclass to return a more specific type than the base class method.

4. **Final Keyword**:  
   - In both **C++** and **Java**, the `final` keyword prevents a method from being overridden.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **C++** requires the `virtual` keyword for overriding, whereas **Java** enables overriding by default for all non-final methods.
- Both languages support runtime polymorphism through base class references or pointers, but C++ adds an extra layer of control through `virtual` and `override` keywords.
