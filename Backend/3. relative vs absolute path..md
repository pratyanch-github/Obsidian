absolute path starts with folder or file name or /
relative path starts with ./ or ../

Take a look at the following code:
``` js
// Relative imports  
import { someFunction } from '../../../what/the/hell'  
import { anotherFunction } from '../../../../../../../please/just/kill-me'  
  
  
// Absolute imports   
import { someFunction } from 'modules/common/what/the/hell'  
import { anotherFunction } from 'services/dark/please/just/kill-me'
```

Which version do you prefer?

> absolute and relative paths have different definitions in react and express apps
> 1. in express , absolute path is calculated from root directory of the project
> 2. in react , we have to define baseurl property in js.config file or ts.config file, 
>
	- Without configuring `baseUrl` (in `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`), React expects all imports to be **relative to the file doing the import**.
	- After configuration, React uses `src` as the root for absolute imports.


Steps to enable absolute imports:

1. Add a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file at the root level:
```json
  {   "compilerOptions": {     "baseUrl": "src"   } }
```
