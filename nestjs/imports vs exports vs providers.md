In NestJS, `import`, `providers`, and `export` are core concepts used to manage the dependency injection (DI) system. Let's break them down step by step:

### 1. **`import`**
   - **What**: `import` is used to bring in other modules into your current module. This allows you to use the providers (services, controllers, etc.) that are declared in another module.
   - **Why**: If you want to use services or other exported members from another module in your current module, you need to import that module. 
   - **How**: You define the `import` array inside a module's metadata to bring in the other modules. 

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   @Module({
     imports: [OtherModule], // Importing OtherModule to access its exported services or controllers
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

### 2. **`providers`**
   - **What**: `providers` are services or classes that provide some functionality. NestJS uses the DI system to inject these providers where needed. A provider could be a service, repository, or any class that has logic.
   - **Why**: Providers are used for dependency injection, meaning they can be injected into other parts of the application (like controllers or other services) to provide shared functionality (like database access, utility functions, etc.).
   - **How**: You declare providers inside the `providers` array of a module. 

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   @Injectable()
   export class SomeService {
     getHello() {
       return 'Hello World';
     }
   }

   @Module({
     providers: [SomeService], // Declaring SomeService as a provider
   })
   export class SomeModule {}
   ```

   Once declared as a provider, `SomeService` can be injected into other services or controllers via constructor injection.

### 3. **`export`**
   - **What**: `export` makes providers (services, controllers, etc.) available to other modules that import this module.
   - **Why**: If a module contains providers that other modules need, you must export those providers so they are accessible when the module is imported elsewhere.
   - **How**: You define the `export` array to make those providers available outside the module.

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   @Module({
     providers: [SomeService],
     exports: [SomeService], // Making SomeService available to other modules
   })
   export class SomeModule {}
   ```

   This allows `SomeService` to be used in any module that imports `SomeModule`.

### Putting It All Together
In NestJS, when working with modules, you often:
- **Import** other modules to access their functionality.
- Declare **providers** that will be injected and used within the module.
- **Export** providers to make them available to other modules.

**Full Example**:
```typescript
// some.module.ts
@Module({
  providers: [SomeService],
  exports: [SomeService], // Exporting SomeService so it can be used in other modules
})
export class SomeModule {}

// app.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [SomeModule], // Importing SomeModule to access SomeService
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(private someService: SomeService) {
    this.someService.getHello(); // Using SomeService in AppModule
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `SomeModule` exports `SomeService`.
- `AppModule` imports `SomeModule` and can now use `SomeService`.

### Key Points:
- **import**: Used to bring in other modules to access their exported services.
- **providers**: Declare services that will be injected where needed.
- **export**: Make providers available for use in other modules when they import your module.
