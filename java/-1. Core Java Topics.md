- Type casting (implicit and explicit)
- Literals (integer, floating-point, character, string, boolean)
- Scope of variables

## 3. Operators
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
- Comparison/Relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)
- Ternary operator (?:)
- Operator precedence

## 4. Control Flow Statements
- Decision-making statements (if, if-else, switch)
- Loop statements (for, while, do-while)

- Enhanced for loop (for-each)
- Labeled statements

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Constructors (default, parameterized, copy)
- Constructor overloading
- this and super keywords
- Methods and method overloading
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Non-access modifiers (static, final, abstract, synchronized, volatile, transient)
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime)
- Abstraction (abstract classes and methods)
- Encapsulation
- Interfaces
- Packages
- Concrete classes vs abstract classes
- Instance and static initializer blocks

## 6. String Handling
- String class and its methods
- String immutability
- StringBuffer and StringBuilder
- String manipulation and comparison
- Regular expressions
- String tokenization
- String formatting

## 7. Arrays
- One-dimensional arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array initialization
- Array manipulation
- Arrays class utility methods
- Jagged arrays
- Array copying techniques

## 8. Exception Handling
- Exception hierarchy
- Checked and unchecked exceptions
- try-catch-finally blocks
- throw and throws keywords
- Custom exceptions
- Exception propagation
- try-with-resources
- Multi-catch blocks

## 9. Java I/O (Input/Output)
- InputStream and OutputStream
- Reader and Writer classes
- File class and operations
- FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
- BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
- PrintWriter and PrintStream

- wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
- Thread pooling
- Thread local variables
- Deadlock, starvation, and race conditions

## 13. Java Enums
- Enum basics
- Enum with constructors, methods, and fields
- EnumSet and EnumMap

## 14. Annotations
- Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings)
- Custom annotations
- Annotation elements
- Meta-annotations

## 15. Java 8+ Core Features
