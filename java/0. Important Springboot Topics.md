# Core Java Backend Developer Foundation - Essential In-Depth Topics

When I say "prioritize depth over breadth," I mean that mastering the fundamental concepts thoroughly will make you a stronger developer than having superficial knowledge of many topics. Here's the essential list of topics you should know in-depth:

## 1. Spring Core Fundamentals

### 1.1 Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control
- How Spring manages objects (beans)
- The bean container and application context
- Different types of dependency injection (constructor, setter, field)
- Why DI matters for testable code

### 1.2 Spring Bean Lifecycle
- Bean initialization and destruction process
- Scope of beans (singleton vs prototype)
- Bean post-processors

### 1.3 Configuration Approaches
- Java-based configuration with @Configuration
- @Component scanning
- Conditional bean creation

## 2. Spring Boot Essentials

### 2.1 Auto-Configuration
- How Spring Boot auto-configures your application
- Overriding default configurations
- Understanding starter dependencies

### 2.2 Application Properties
- Configuration with properties files
- Environment-specific properties (profiles)
- Externalizing configuration
- Type-safe configuration with @ConfigurationProperties

### 2.3 Spring Boot Actuator
- Health endpoints
- Basic monitoring

## 3. REST API Development

### 3.1 Spring MVC Fundamentals
- Request processing lifecycle
- Controllers and request mappings
- HTTP method mappings (@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.)

### 3.2 Request & Response Handling
- Request parameters and path variables
- Request body processing with @RequestBody
- Response formatting with ResponseEntity
- Content negotiation

### 3.3 Exception Handling
- @ExceptionHandler
- Global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
- Error response structure

### 3.4 Validation
- Bean Validation (JSR 380)
- Validation groups
- Custom validators

## 4. Data Access

### 4.1 JPA Core Concepts
- Entity lifecycle (managed, detached, etc.)
- Entity relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, etc.)
- Eager vs. lazy loading
- Cascading operations

### 4.2 Spring Data JPA
- Repository pattern implementation
- Query methods
- JPQL vs. native queries
- Pagination and sorting

### 4.3 Transaction Management
- @Transactional annotation
- Transaction propagation
- Transaction isolation levels
- Common pitfalls (LazyInitializationException)

## 5. Security Basics

### 5.1 Authentication & Authorization
- Spring Security filter chain
- SecurityContext and Authentication object
- User details service

### 5.2 Web Security Configuration
- URL-based security
- Method-level security
- CSRF protection

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Testing services and components
- Mocking with Mockito
- Testing best practices

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Spring Boot test framework
- Testing controllers with MockMvc
- Testing repositories with @DataJpaTest

## 7. Application Deployment & Operations

### 7.1 Application Packaging
- Creating executable JARs
- Understanding the Spring Boot executable JAR structure

### 7.2 Logging
- Logging configuration
- Log levels
- Common logging patterns

## Real-World Implementation Skills

### 1. RESTful API Design
- Resource modeling
- HTTP method selection
- Status code usage
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting

### 2. Database Design with JPA
- Entity design best practices
- Efficient relationships
- Indexing strategies
- Performance considerations

### 3. Service Layer Design
- Separation of concerns
- Transaction boundaries
- Business logic organization

## Study Strategy

1. **Master one topic before moving to the next**. For example, fully understand dependency injection before diving into Spring Data JPA.

2. **Build small, focused projects** to apply each concept. For instance, create a simple CRUD application after learning Spring Data JPA.

3. **Revisit core concepts repeatedly**. The Spring container, request processing lifecycle, and JPA entity lifecycle are concepts that become clearer with repeated exposure and application.

4. **Read source code** of Spring Boot auto-configurations to understand how they work.

5. **Practice explaining concepts** as if you were in an interview. Being able to explain how Spring Boot works indicates deeper understanding.

This focused list contains the topics that form the strong foundation of a Java backend developer's knowledge. These are the concepts you'll use daily and that interviewers will expect you to understand thoroughly. By mastering these core areas in depth, you'll be better equipped to tackle more advanced topics when needed.
